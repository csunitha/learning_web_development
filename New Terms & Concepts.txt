Behaviour Driven Development(BDD)
  BDD is three things in one - tests, documentation and examples.

Chai
  The library with many assertions. It allows to use a lot of different assertions.

Headless Chrome
  Headless Chrome is a way to run the Chrome Browser without actually running Chrome.
  A headless browser is a great tool for automated testing and server environments where you don't need a visible UI shell. For example, you may want to run some tests against a real web page, create a PDF of it, or just inspect how the browser renders an URL.

Linters
  JSLint – one of the first linters.
  JSHint – more settings than JSLint.
  ESLint – probably the newest one.

Mocha
  The core framework: it provides common testing functions including describe and it and the main function that runs tests.

Puppeteer is a Node library API that allows us to control headless Chrome.

Sinon
  A library to spy over functions, emulate built-in functions and more, we’ll need it much later.
