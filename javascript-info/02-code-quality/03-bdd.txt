Before creating a code, we need to imagine the function and describe it.
This is called specification / spec.

e.g of a spec for function pow
------------------------------

describe ("pow", function() {

  it("raises to n-th power", function() {
    assert.equal( pow(2,3), 8 );
  });

});

Spec contains 3 building blocks
-------------------------------
  1. describe
    What functionality we are describing
          -> describe ("title", function() {...});
    this is used to group "workers" - the it blocks

  2. it
    this has title the describes the test and function that test it
          -> it("description of test", function() {...});

  3. assert
    the code inside the it block - if implementation correct should execute without errors.
